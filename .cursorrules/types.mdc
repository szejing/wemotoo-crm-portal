# Types and Request/Response Models

## Where Types Live

- **app/utils/types/** – Domain and UI types (Product, Order, Customer, Tax, etc.) used across components, tables, and forms.
- **app/repository/.../models/request/** – Request body/query types for API calls (`*.req.ts`).
- **app/repository/.../models/response/** – Response types for API calls (`*.resp.ts`).
- **app/utils/interface/** – Shared UI/data interfaces (e.g. range, data-stat).

## Conventions

### Naming
- Types/interfaces: PascalCase (`Product`, `OrderItem`, `CreateProductReq`).
- Use a short suffix when helpful: `*Req` / `*Resp` for API, `*Model` when it’s a view/table model.

### Shapes
- Align with backend DTOs and API responses so repository and server proxying stay type-safe.
- Prefer `type` for unions and mapped shapes; use `interface` when you need declaration merging or default exports.
- Use optional `?` and `| null` where the API or form can omit or null the field.

### Reuse
- Put shared fields (ids, codes, dates) in a base type or reuse types from `utils/types` in repository models.
- Avoid duplicating the same shape in both `utils/types` and `repository/.../models`; import from one place when they represent the same thing.

### Enums and Constants
- Prefer enums and constants from `wemotoo-common` for status, role, and shared codes.
- Define app-only enums or const objects in `utils/types` or `utils/constants` when they don’t belong in the shared package.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Duplicate type definitions for the same API shape in multiple files
- ❌ Using `any` for request/response or domain types
- ❌ Putting request/response types in `utils/types` when they are only used by one repository module – keep them in that module’s `models/`
